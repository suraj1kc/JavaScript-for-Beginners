// ====================
// History of JavaScript
// ====================

// JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, but its origins are rooted in the early days of the web.
// Understanding the history of JavaScript helps us appreciate how it has evolved into the powerful language it is today.

// --------------------
// The Birth of JavaScript
// --------------------
// - JavaScript was created in **1995** by **Brendan Eich**, an engineer at **Netscape Communications**.
// - Initially, it was called **LiveScript**, but Netscape decided to rename it to **JavaScript** to capitalize on the popularity of **Java**, another programming language that was gaining traction at the time.
// - Despite the similar names, JavaScript and Java are entirely different languages with different purposes and use cases.

// --------------------
// Early Adoption
// --------------------
// - JavaScript made its first appearance in **Netscape Navigator 2.0** in 1995.
// - It was designed to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, which were mostly static at the time.
// - Soon after, other web browsers like **Internet Explorer** adopted JavaScript, making it a standard for web development.

// --------------------
// Standardization: ECMAScript
// --------------------
// - In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to the **European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)** for standardization.
// - The standardized version of the language was named **ECMAScript** (officially ECMA-262) to avoid trademark issues.
// - **ECMAScript** is the official name of the language, while **JavaScript** is the most popular implementation of the ECMAScript standard.
// - The standardization process ensured that JavaScript would work consistently across different browsers and platforms.

// --------------------
// Evolution of JavaScript
// --------------------
// JavaScript has gone through several major updates over the years, with each version introducing new features and improvements.

// 1. **ES3 (1999)**:
//    - Added regular expressions, better string handling, and exception handling.
//    - This version solidified JavaScript as a mature programming language.

// 2. **ES5 (2009)**:
//    - Introduced strict mode, JSON support, and new array methods like `map()` and `filter()`.
//    - ES5 was a significant update that made JavaScript more powerful and developer-friendly.

// 3. **ES6 (2015)**:
//    - Also known as **ECMAScript 2015** or **ES2015**, this was a major update to the language.
//    - Introduced features like `let` and `const`, arrow functions, classes, modules, and template literals.
//    - ES6 marked the beginning of annual updates to the ECMAScript standard.

// 4. **ES7 and Beyond**:
//    - Since ES6, new versions of ECMAScript have been released annually, adding smaller but impactful features.
//    - Examples include `async/await` (ES2017), optional chaining (ES2020), and private class fields (ES2022).

// --------------------
// JavaScript Today
// --------------------
// - JavaScript is now a cornerstone of modern web development, used for both front-end and back-end development.
// - It powers millions of websites and applications, from simple interactive forms to complex single-page applications (SPAs).
// - With the rise of frameworks like **React**, **Angular**, and **Vue.js**, JavaScript has become even more versatile and powerful.

// --------------------
// JavaScript and Oracle
// --------------------
// - The name **JavaScript** is a trademark of **Oracle Corporation**, which acquired it through the purchase of Sun Microsystems (the original owner of the JavaScript trademark).
// - Despite the trademark, JavaScript is an open standard, and its development is guided by the ECMA International organization.

// --------------------
// Importance of ECMAScript
// --------------------
// - **ECMAScript** is the official standard that defines the JavaScript language.
// - It ensures that JavaScript remains consistent and compatible across different browsers and platforms.
// - Developers often refer to JavaScript versions by their ECMAScript version (e.g., ES6, ES2015, ES2020).

// --------------------
// Key Takeaways for Students
// --------------------
// - JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich and originally named LiveScript.
// - It was standardized as ECMAScript in 1996 to ensure consistency across browsers.
// - ES6 (2015) was a major update that introduced many modern features.
// - JavaScript is now a versatile language used for both front-end and back-end development.

// ====================
// Summary
// ====================
// JavaScript has come a long way since its creation in 1995. From its humble beginnings as a simple scripting language for web pages, it has evolved into a powerful and versatile programming language that powers the modern web. Its standardization as ECMAScript and continuous updates have ensured its relevance and dominance in the world of web development.
